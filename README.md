Here are some solutions to the June 26 2016 [Sunday Puzzle from NPR](http://www.npr.org/series/4473090/sunday-puzzle).

A couple resources I used:

[GeoNames](http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/download_data.htm), 'Populated Places' A text file with city and states.

[Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-populated-places/), 'Populated Places' A dbf (DBase 3) file with cities, countries, and population.
